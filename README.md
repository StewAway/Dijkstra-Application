#### Description:
+Install numba and shapely
  
+run the app

1)MAP button is for generating a random map from map0->map9.

2)After generating your map, the left mouse click is for the starting point, and the right mouse click is for the ending point.

3)With the two given points, click the RUN button to calculate the shortest yellow path between 2 given points through the edges of the polygon.
